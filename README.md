# Deep Learning-Based Dual-Input Framework for Triad Classification of Myocardial Perfusion Polar Maps


This project involved working from scratch on a dual-input deep learning model based on ResNet18 architecture to classify Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) polar maps into three categories: normal, ischemia, and infarction.

Key features include:

Developed the model and training pipeline entirely from scratch using a real dataset collected from 87 patients.

Utilized transfer learning by freezing early layers to reduce the requirement for large labeled datasets.

Achieved a 94.8% accuracy on test data.

Applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness and generalization.
